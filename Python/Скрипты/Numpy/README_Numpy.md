# Instruction for using functions in numpy_challenge.py file

Functions:
  1. **different_arrays** - gives you 3 different arrays.
  2. **matrix_multiplication** - receive 2 matricies and returns result of multiplication of these matricies.
  3. **multiplication_check** - receive list of matricies and if it is possible to make matrix multiplication in their order, returns True; 
  in the other case - returns False.
  4. **compute_2d_distance** - receive 2 arrays with pair of values in each and returns euclidean distance between their values.
  5. **compute_multidimensional_distance** - receive 2 arrays with values and returns euclidean distance between their values 
  (size of arrays may be any, but should not be different).
  6. compute_pair_distances - receive matrix and returns matrix of pair distances.
  
  You should give correct input data to this function and then you will recieve correct output.
  Good luck!
